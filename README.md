# Classification-of-Network-Attacks-using-Bot-IOT-Dataset
The Bot-IoT dataset is a publicly available dataset containing network traffic data captured from an IoT (Internet of Things) network, where IoT devices are communicating with each other and with the Internet.The Bot-IoT dataset contains data captured from an IoT network, which includes both 
legitimate traffic (traffic generated by normal devices) and traffic generated by botnets 
where Botnets are networks of devices that have been compromised by a remote 
attacker and are under their control. This means that the attacker can use the botnet to 
carry out various types of attacks, such as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks 
or spreading malware. The dataset captures this malicious traffic and can be used to 
analyse and understand the behaviour of IoT botnets, which can help in developing 
better defenses against them.
By analysing the Bot-IoT dataset, researchers and security professionals can gain 
insights into how IoT botnets operate. They can identify how botnets spread, how they 
communicate with each other and the internet, and the types of attacks they carry out. 
This information can help in developing better defenses against IoT botnets and 
improving the security of IoT devices and networks. For example, security measures 
can be implemented to detect and prevent botnet communication patterns or to identify 
and quarantine compromised devices.
As the number of IoT devices continues to grow and their vulnerabilities become more 
evident, analysing datasets like Bot-IoT can aid in developing effective security 
measures and policies to safeguard IoT devices and the networks they are connected to. 
Studying these datasets helps researchers and security professionals to better understand 
the threat landscape of IoT networks, and in turn, develop more robust defenses against 
emerging threats.

It is important to secure the IoT devices from security attacks and ensure the 
stability of IoT systems, preventing potential security breaches that can lead to privacy 
violations, data loss, or service disruption. A novel, more reliable detection approach 
may be offered by machine learning models. Without ongoing human oversight, ML 
models can recognize attacks and take appropriate action. To solve this problem, a broad 
range of Machine Learning Algorithms are researched, and the best one is selected to be XGBoost with highest accuracy. 
Our aim is to illustrate the commonly used protocols in Industrial Internet 
of Things (IIoT) and the associated risks.
